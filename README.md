# Assignment 07 - Pickling and Exception Handling
**Dev:** *KPhan*  
**Date:** *2/28/2023*

## Introduction
In this assignment, I will explain the steps I used to create a simple python calculator script that will enable a user to select a menu choice, two inputs to calculate, and what calculation to perform. The script will also “pickle” the user’s option into a binary file as to encrypt the user’s menu choice. The script was created in Pycharm IDE and will be run on the Pycharm IDE and OS Command/Terminal on a Macintosh operating system.

## Objective
My objective for this script is to provide the user a menu of options numbered 1-6. As shown in code block below. The options I’ve provided are the following:
1)	Calculate Sum
2)	Calculate Difference
3)	Calculate Product
4)	Calculate Quotient
5)	Exit Program
